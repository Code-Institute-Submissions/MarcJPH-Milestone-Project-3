### Introduction
#### Childrens Day Out.com is a newly created website that provides places and activities for children in and around the East of Scotland. The site will provide detail on these places but also allow users to add places that they have visited that have not yet been documented on the site.

![Site Mock Up](wireframes/)

### User Experience

The website will be simple to navigate and hold enough information on the places and activities for the user to make a decision if this is somewhere they would like to visit. Users will have to register to use the site however this will allow them to add and edit the additions they have made.

User Stories to help achieve this user experience:

User:

1. As a user of the webiste, I want to view what places have been recommended to visit with my children.
2. As a user of the website, I want to have easy access to purchasing tickets for the place, if required.
3. As a user of the website, I want to be able to add and review places I have visited that my children enjoyed so other people are aware and can visit.



Site Owner:

1. As the owner of the website, I want to ensure it is easy to find places people can visit with their children, allowing filtering and searching so users don't have to scroll through a list of places they are not interested in.
2. As the owner of the website, as I have agreed a percentage of the tickets bought via accessing the places website via my site, I want the access to purchase tickets to be obvious to the user and simple to use.
3. As the owner of the website, I want users to have the ability to add places and recommendations for other to visit that are not already listed on the website.

#### Responsiveness

The website and the game user experiance is functioning well across the different screen sizes for the different devices. As well as using the options within Google Lighthouse, [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) was also used to test how the site would look and feel on the different sceen sizes. Landscape and portrait were tested with the social media links being a slight concern in that horizontal scrolling was required for them to be fully visible. This could be amended in the next iteration of the game.
